# Angular SpringBoot First Project

As a learning exercise, I developed a simple application using Angular and Spring Boot. This project incorporates full CRUD functionality and utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval. While primarily intended as a learning tool, it has provided a solid foundation for future development with these technologies.

## How to run

 TO run this project you need to have a working postgresql database. Run the backend part before then run the frontend part of the project.
